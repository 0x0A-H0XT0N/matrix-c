# DESCRIPTION

Matrix-c uses matrices to encode and decode messages using multiplication and inverse matrices.

Matrix-c was part of a math project for my class. 

# LANGUAGE

The program is writen in pt-br, since it was made for my class

Comments are writen in en-us

I'm too lazy to translate this README
